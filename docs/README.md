Call for Volunteers

Actually i build an maintain all you see: dev, "try it" named test,
dev diary and docs. if you should learn me how to make them more easy,
i'm happy to learn how. Probably if you do % works you also pick % earns
because it's a job.

Docs are available in [ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ EN](./en/index.md) and in [ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ IT](./it/index.md).
Both are incomplete and needs volunteers to collaborate and maintain it.
