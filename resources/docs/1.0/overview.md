## First Visit? What is yaPCP?

Well, you are landed on "The User Docs of yaPCP".  
First: what mean `Y A P C P`?  
It's like
[YMCA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YMCA)?
[YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML)?  
In My Humble words: "Yeah, an *Amazing* Photo Contest Platform".

What you can do in yaPCP, *a photo contest platform*?

You can register in and play as *Contest participant*, and/or (with some restrictions) *Contest organizer*, and/or *Contest juror*, and/or Platform manager, and act as *Federation refer*.

### Contest Participant

- Register to our platform and upload your photos.
- See the contest list, and easy participate to one or more.
- Be quiet, no anytime reinsert your data to participate next contest. Change anytime their change.

### Member of Contest Organizer

- Add and manage your planned photo contest, in a way compliant for your sponsor federation.
- Some checks are automate but not at all. You decide who are ok for Jury review or ask author if some few pixels seems wrong.
- in a sum-based-votes view you can decide what set of works are "admit".
- You manage the final jury and assign prizes, with a minute contest redacted automatically with no error and signed fast from juror.
- You give automatic report and zip with photo ready for catalogue.
- List of participants, and list of photo in nicely order.

### Contest Juror

- For the period preceding the final meeting, you can assign and manage assigned vote for every section-n-theme.
- Before the final meeting you should vote for a go n stop

and others like *participate as Juror*, or as collaborator
for local translations or develop.
