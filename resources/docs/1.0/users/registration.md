## Registration

We require data asked from all the contests form,
starting from a name, an email address, and a
password. Pay attention to e-mail address because
a message is sended to check email address and s
with password your unique entry key.

For a good password we say the
usual sysadmin recommendations: use some non-sense phrases
joining 5-6 short words and with '-', i.e.
*dont-hack-my-yapcp-26-entry-pass-phrase* 😁.
Size matters, specially for passwords.
We can't recover your password anyway, and you
and solely you are responsible etc.

Check carefully all your data before submit, as usual.  
First field is labeled Surname, Name. Plz use the comma to separate surname and name, i.e. Hill, Benny. That and email field became the seed of your Contact cards.
