## Registration

First we ask few infos, the minimum required to access
next. A name, an email address, and we suggest a
long, strong password. For password we say the
usual sysadmin recommendations: use some non-sense phrases
joining 5-6 short words and with '-', i.e.
dont-hack-my-yapcp-26-entry-pass-phrase 😁.
Size matters, even for passwords.
We can't recover your password anyway.

Check carefully all your data then an email will reach
your box to verify it's a real and monitored address.
It's also the key to enter in log in.
