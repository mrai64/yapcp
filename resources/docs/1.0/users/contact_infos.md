To participate at every contest you must insert *eeeveeeeryyytiiiimeeee*
your personal data, and even here. But, as we hosting also
some contest, you enter infos only first time, and
no more. Then participate to more contest and
update your data when you need. Sounds good? It's REAL.

And that's not all, only if you sign an agreement with yaPCP, we can
do that work for you. Our plan is to create trust relation with
other contest platform to send them your data and works when and only
when you ask us to do. Sounds good?

After you register in yaPCP platform we provide a space how
record your personal data: first name, surname / family name,
email. Are you the ONLY AND UNIQUE John Smith in USA? No?
So we ask also you the postal address, and other info.
Some of that infos remain *reserved for yaPCP* to communicate with you thru
email, sms, or whatsapp.

Here we reunite your personal contact infos, these are the data
we use to send your participation to any Contest hosted in yaPCP,
completed with extra data required from national/international Federation
for internal report and distinctions management.

## One more

Most contest have a federation sponsorship,
aka *Patronage*, but for catalogue and reports the federation require some data infos, *One more info* i.e. federation card id.

For every federation that have an identifiable
set of fields required, we propose a panel
(all of facultative fields) to insert if you have.

In that sample Italian federation FIAF

Field name, label, suggestion and default value
are proposed. Only a suggestion: if you
want remove a previous or wrong value,
insert the *default* value.
